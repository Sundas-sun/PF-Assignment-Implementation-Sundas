## Introduction

This repository contains 30 C++ programs created as part of the programming assignment.

Each program covers basic concepts such as:
- variables  
- operators  
- mathematical expressions  
- input and output  
- constants  
- escape sequences  
- simple decision-making  

All programs follow this naming format:


question-no-1.cpp
question-no-2.cpp
...
question-no-30.cpp

## How to Run the Programs

### Compile


g++ question-no-1.cpp -o q1


### Run


./q1
How to Run the Programs

To run the C++ programs, follow these steps:

1. Open your preferred *online C++ compiler* (e.g., [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/)).
2. Create a *new C++ file*.
3. *Copy* the code from the desired program file (e.g., `question-no-1/main.cpp`) and *paste it* into the editor.
4. Click *Run/Execute* to compile and run the program.
5. Repeat the steps for any other program file you'd like to run.



Replace the file name to run any other question.
